# alternative stdlib

> **WIP**

This is intended to be a replacement for some of the standard library data structures as well as (maybe) other utilities (such as optionals).

This project is heavily inspired by [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

There is a `common.hpp` file with some commonly used things but other than that everything is self-contained and can just be included as is.
